## Assignment & Repo Details

1. This assignment was to create storyboard frames about me using a software called Figma

3. The beginning frame has my personal information, the middle 3 frames depict theme words I connected with, and the final panel brings it all together. 

4. Inside the report folder, you will find the report.qmd and report.html files which show all of my frames as pngs, with each frame having a description of why I chose the certain theme word, the design choices of the frame, as well as the dynamic elements that I am planning on adding when these frames become dynamic after they're coded up.

5. The report also has links to the actual Figma file and a link to this github repo.

6. The assets folder also holds png files to each of the Figma frames.
